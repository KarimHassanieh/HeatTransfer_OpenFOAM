Create time

Create mesh for time = 0

Creating single patch per inter-region interface.

Trying to match regions to existing cell zones.


Number of regions:3

Writing region per cell file (for manual decomposition) to "constant/cellToRegion"

Writing region per cell as volScalarField to "0/cellToRegion"

Region	Cells
------	-----
0	13300
1	6700
2	20000

Region	Zone	Name
------	----	----
0	1	B
1	2	C
2	0	A

Sizes of interfaces between regions:

Interface	Region	Region	Faces
---------	------	------	-----
0		0	1	100
1		1	2	67
2		0	2	133

Reading geometric fields
